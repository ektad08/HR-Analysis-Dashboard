# Project : HR Analysis 
## Problem Statement 
Employee attrition is a significant challenge faced by organizations, impacting productivity, morale, and overall business performance. Understanding the factors contributing to attrition is crucial for implementing effective retention strategies. The lack of a comprehensive analysis tool makes it difficult for HR professionals to identify trends and take proactive measures.

The aim of this project is to develop an Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard that provides HR professionals with the necessary metrics and visualizations to understand and manage attrition effectively. The dashboard will enable them to track key metrics such as employee count, attrition rate, and average age, along with visualizations that highlight department-wise attrition, employees by age group, and attrition rate by gender. These insights will empower HR professionals to make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and organizational performance.
